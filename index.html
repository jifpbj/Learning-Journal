      <h1>My new journey as a Fullstack Engineer</h1>
      <p>
        After years of telling stories through illustrations in the
        entertainment world, I realized I wanted to start building the tools
        behind the scenes. Now, I’m diving into software engineering—bringing
        the same creativity to code that I once brought to the canvas.

        <h1>Why I Traded My Stylus for a Keyboard</h1>
        <p>
          There’s something electrifying about typing your first lines of
          code—like unlocking a new superpower you didn’t know you had.

        <h1>Why Learning to Code Feels Like Magic</h1>
        <p>
          After that first “Hello, world,” I was hooked—every bug became a
          puzzle, every solution a little victory, and suddenly, the screen
          wasn’t just glowing—it was speaking back.

        <h1>The Dream Started to Hurt</h1>
        <p>
          Sometimes, working in entertainment art felt like pouring your soul
          into a piece just to have it buried under endless revisions or left
          unseen. It’s tough watching passion turn into burnout in a system that
          rarely values the artist as much as the outcome.

        <h1>I Started Looking Elsewhere</h1>
        <p>
          I didn’t want to stop creating—but I knew I couldn’t keep creating
          like this. So I started exploring, wondering what it might feel like
          to build something where my effort actually felt seen.

        <h1>The Day I Wrote My First Line of Code</h1>
        <p>
          It wasn’t fancy—just a few words on a screen—but it felt like a
          doorway. For the first time in a long time, I was excited to learn
          again, with no gatekeepers, no approvals—just pure creation.

        <h1>I’m Still an Artist—Just in a New Medium</h1>
        <p>
          Code is starting to feel like sketching with logic. It’s different,
          but it’s mine—and for the first time, I’m building a future that feels
          like it belongs to me.
